A project developed as a part of job interview assignment.

## Problem Statement
The owner of a guitar store wants to keep an inventory of all the guitars he owns. 
He noticed the customers ask for guitars based on their brand names or model names, 
the type of the guitar i.e electric or acoustic, the number of strings, and the price. 
Each guitar has a unique serial number which he uses to track the guitar. He also needs 
to keep a track of when he bought the instrument and when he sold it.

Along with the guitars he also sells accessories for them. He sells two kinds of guitar picks
- a wooden one for acoustic guitars, and a plastic one for electric guitars.

He also sells straps for all the guitars. There are three types of straps, regular, large and extra large.

## Question:
Create a web application with the following functionality:

1. An index page that lists all the guitars in the system. This page should allow you to search 
for guitars by name, brand name, or model.

2. You should be able to add any number of guitars from the index page to your cart. And optionally 
add accessories. You should be able to choose any number of accessories from the available ones.

3. The shopping cart should be viewable from all the pages and should show all the details about 
the guitar(s) (and accessories, if any) including the unit price, the quantity per item, and the 
total price of all the items in the cart.
